      "Spike is an outstanding business consultant. We worked with him to find a new direction for a medium-sized non-profit organization called 'Sferracavalli' based in Southern Italy. His insights and his work on the field with us helped us focus on the important assets of our organization, on the core values that inspired us to create it, on our business model and on the definition of a set of rules/tools we need to keep the organization going. As a startupper I worked with a couple of consultants in the past. No one provided the kind of value Spike provided to us. Spike was generous, transparent, inspiring, precise. I'll definitely work with him again in the near future.",

The areas where he contributed with great ideas ranged from how to select a target market, pricing considerations and models, and trialing strategies. All extremely useful and practical. On top of all this, he followed-up our conversation with a summary outlining a recommended strategy I could immediately start to work on and see results from.

We also discussed strategies to grandfather testers and scale out, looked at life time value, and what metrics to measure (and how to measure them) to make sure we're headed in the right direction. It was quite an informative and helpful session for my partner and I - Spike really made us feel like he was there to help and make a positive difference. Thanks Spike!",

He understands investors, customers, and most importantly entrepreneurs, and is able to pinpoint the critical flaws that many times get overlooked. He goes above and beyond what you'd normally expect from a mentor. He truly cares about the internal value of entrepreneurship and continues to stay in contact and follow up with me on my company's progress.

From a simple question like, 'Should I have a third pricing option on my landing page?', he took the time to explain pricing psychology, gave examples of how different companies approached the topic and their results, and talked through how to bring up pricing in a customer interview. He understood the intent of my question, and gave me great context and background that led to better questions and a richer conversation. I wish more people did that.",
